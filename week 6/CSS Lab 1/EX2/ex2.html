                <p>Ancient Roman architecture adopted the
                    external language of classical Greek architecture
                    for the purposes of the ancient Romans, but
                    grew so different from Greek buildings as to
                    become a new architectural style. The two styles
                    are often considered one body of classical
                    architecture. Roman architecture flourished in
                    the Roman Republic and even more so under
                    the Empire, when the great majority of surviving
                    buildings were constructed. It used new
                    materials, particularly concrete, and newer
                    technologies such as the arch and the dome to
                    make buildings that were typically strong and
                    well-engineered. Large numbers remain in some
                    form across the empire, sometimes complete
                    and still in use.</p>

                <p>The architecture of ancient Greece is the
                    architecture produced by the Greek-speaking
                    people (Hellenic people) whose culture
                    flourished on the Greek mainland, the
                    Peloponnese, the Aegean Islands, and in
                    colonies in Anatolia and Italy for a period from
                    about 900 BC until the 1st century AD, with the
                    earliest remaining architectural works dating
                    from around 600 BC.[1] Ancient Greek
                    architecture is best known from its temples,
                    many of which are found throughout the region,
                    mostly as ruins but many substantially intact.
                    The second important type of building that
                    survives all over the Hellenic world is the open-
                    air theatre, with the earliest dating from around
                    525-480 BC.</p>

                <p>Indian architecture is as old as the history of
                    the civilization. The earliest remains of recognizable building activity in the India dates
                    back to the Indus Valley cities. Among India's
                    ancient architectural remains, the most
                    characteristic are the temples, Chaityas,
                    Viharas, Stupas and other religious structures.
                    In ancient India, temple architecture of high
                    standard developed in almost all regions. The
                    distinct architectural style of temple construction
                    in different parts was a result of geographical,
                    dimatic, ethnic, racial, historical and linguistic
                    diversities. The Rock-cut structures present the
                    most spectacular piece of ancient Indian art
                    specimen. Most of the rock-cut structures were
                    related to various religious communities.</p>
